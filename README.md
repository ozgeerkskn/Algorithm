ðŸ“Š Algorithm Performance Benchmark â€“ Sorting & Searching
This repository contains the implementation and performance comparison of four sorting algorithms and two searching algorithms.

âœ¨ Implemented Algorithms:
Sorting

Merge Sort

Heap Sort

Quick Sort

Selection Sort

Searching

Exponential Search

Binary Search

ðŸ“Œ Features:
Random array generation for different input sizes:
N = 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000

Execution time measurement using high-resolution timers

Searching for a non-existent value (e.g., -1) in sorted arrays

Visual and tabular comparison of runtime performance
